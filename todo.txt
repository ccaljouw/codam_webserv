TODO:
- Root shit
	The root  base directory for the entire server. 
	It serves as the default root for all locations unless overridden in specific location blocks.
	The location / block inherits the server-level root unless overwritte/path/to/server/root; directive at the server level sets then in the block.

- Redirects
	HTTP Status Codes: Redirects are implemented using HTTP status codes. The most common status codes for redirects are:
		301 Moved Permanently: Indicates a permanent redirect.
		302 Found (or 307 Temporary Redirect): Indicates a temporary redirect. 
		Browsers may not cache this, and the original URL may be used in future requests.
	Location Header: The server sends a response with the appropriate status code along with a Location header that contains the new URL.
		response.setHeader("Location", "http://" + ("Host") + req.path);

- dir listing (if 404 and dir listing == 1, call script with dir=.... in query string) -Carlo
	"Turn on or off directory listing" refers to the ability to display a list of files within a directory 
	when the client requests a URL that corresponds to a directory rather than a specific file. Directory 
	listing is also known as directory browsing or index listing.

- Set a default file to answer if the request is a directory
	When directory listing is turned on, and a client requests a URL that maps to a directory (e.g., http://example.com/directory/), 
	the web server generates and displays a page containing a list of files and subdirectories within that directory. 
	Each file or subdirectory is typically presented as a clickable link.

- Research how to test

- change scripts with root -Bruno
- cookie script -Bruno

- cleanup includes

DONE:
- Delete (Bruno)
- finish config parser (check for at least all mandatory settings in location / and server) -Bruno
- Error pages - add check on defined error pages for server 
- change scripts with root -Bruno
- add PID to connection (Bruno)

ERROR CODES TO CONSIDER:
408 Request Timeout
413 Payload Too Large
	The 413 Payload Too Large status code means the server refuses to process the request because 
	the request payload is larger than the server is able or willing to process. While the server 
	may close the connection to prevent the client from continuing the request, it should generate 
	a Retry-After header field and after how long can the client retry.
429 Too Many Requests
501/418 Not Implemented

CHECK/THOUGHTS:
- close connection header CGI
- check cgi timeout
- only update nr of times visited when GET request with .html extension. That way it would maybe make some more sense to the user.
